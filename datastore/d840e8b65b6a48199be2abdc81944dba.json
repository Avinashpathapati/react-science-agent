It seeks to reconcile general relativity, which describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime, with the principles of quantum mechanics, which describe the behavior of matter and energy at very small scales. There are several approaches to quantum gravity, including string theory and loop quantum gravity, which attempt to describe the quantum behavior of the"]}}
