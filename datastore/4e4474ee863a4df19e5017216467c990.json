In quantum mechanics, the state of a system is described by a wavefunction, which is a mathematical object that encodes all the information about the system. The wavefunction can be thought of as a probability distribution, which gives the probability of observing the system in a particular state. In string theory, the behavior of strings is described by a"]}}
