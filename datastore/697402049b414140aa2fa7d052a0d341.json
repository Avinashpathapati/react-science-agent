AI systems use mathematical models and algorithms to analyze data, make predictions, and make decisions. For example, linear algebra and calculus are used to train machine learning models, while probability theory and statistics are used to evaluate the performance of these models. Additionally, AI systems often use optimization algorithms to find the best solution to a problem, and these algorithms are based on mathematical principles such as"]}}
